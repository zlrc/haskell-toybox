# Welcome
These are just some toy programs I made while I was learning to program in Haskell. It's rather sparse at the moment, but I might add to it in the future.

## Compiling and Running
NOTE: Make sure that you have GHC installed first.    
**Method 1 (easiest)**: `runhaskell filename.hs`  
**Method 2**: `ghc --make filename` to compile, and `./filename` to run.
